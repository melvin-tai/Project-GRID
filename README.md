### Project GRID (Geological Responsive and Informative Device)

    Project Time: December 2024 - February 2025

- Designed and prototyped a reliable emergency utility device using the ESP32 microcontroller and Arduino Code (adapted C++) to provide lost adventurers and travellers in need with sufficient power to prolong survival time.
- Engineered an embedded multi-sensor system with DHT22, DS3231, and SSD1306 to offer synchronized date, time, temperature, and humidity, alongside survival tools including a fire-starter, built-in compass, and emergency whistle.
- Integrating traditional handheld generator design with water turbine accessories to enhance energy collection process, and implementing a battery consumption monitoring system using INA219 to enhance user experience and resilience. 
- Optimized material costs through 3D modeling with Tinkercad and prototyping with PLA Pro, ensuring the feasibility of a high quality design model with low defect rate and scalable production and commercialization potential.
